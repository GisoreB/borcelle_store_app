# borcelle_store_app

This project is a test store developed in Flutter, using the FakeStore API (https://fakestoreapi.com), 
a free REST API that provides pseudo-real e-commerce data. The FakeStore API is a valuable tool for developers
who want to test and develop e-commerce applications without the need to rely on real-world backend systems.

The FakeStore API offers a variety of endpoints that allow you to fetch detailed information about products, 
categories, and user data. This provides a rich and realistic development experience, allowing you to create
a fully functional e-commerce store with a variety of products and categories.

With the FakeStore API, this project demonstrates how it is possible to create a robust and functional e-commerce store,
using the best development practices in Flutter and the MVC architecture.
